# SP500
Dataset downloaded from finance.yahoo.com (S&P 500 Historical Data)</br>
codebase run on google colab - DLPROJECT.ipynb</br>
Report - FinalReport_PG2374.pdf</br>
Dataset - SP500.csv</br>

Optimizers - Adam and Adagrad</br>
Activation Functions - relu, leaky_relu, softmax
Epochs - The models reached a minimum loss approximately around 20 epochs.</br>
The validation accuracy is not very high and around 0.17 for CNN-LSTM. --> This could be due to small size of dataset (approximately 3000 values) vs model (approximately 100k parameters)</br>
BatchSize Variation - The difference was in training time and loss and accuracy values are same.</br>
